# ImageScanner

this program converts all colors of an image to the colors used in Minecraft map art on a server called vulengate
which has a plugin that lets you paint on a canvas 
using this you can see what an image would look like if you painted it exactly in Minecraft

the scanner creates a text filee with the dye names needed to achieve the color when painting in game  
\+ means the color should have 1 extra light shade applied
\- means the color should have 1 extra dark shade applied
